      "benefits": "A Kilometer Space Telescope (KST) will provide over three times the diameter and ten times the collecting area of the Arecibo ground-based radio telescope with diffraction-limited performance at optical, infrared, and millimeter wavelengths. This capability is orders of magnitude improvement over the Hubble (HST) and James Webb (JWST) instruments. Dramatic increases in resolution and sensitivity will enable breakthrough science in the discovery and study of terrestrial planets, including spectroscopic search for signatures of life and intelligent life, and the study of some of the very early light emitting objects in the universe. Unlike other proposed approaches to kilometer class apertures such as interferometers or the Aragoscope, which are all photon starved, the filled aperture KST will be photon rich. A KST would revolutionize astronomy in ways we cannot now imagine.  For example, no one predicted that the most stunning images from HST would be of Planetary Nebulae. And HST was only one order of magnitude finer than its predecessors. We will certainly spend more time in Phase II looking at what might be some of the driving science issues, but for now we simply state that the KST will give us an unparalleled new view of the Universe. Wherever it looks it will make new discoveries.    The enabling technology also can be used for sun shades for the KST itself, as well as star shades for coronagraphic examination of terrestrial exoplanets. An early use of this technology could even be to launch star shades for use with JWST. It is possible to deploy structures 100 million times the volume of the launch vehicle payload bay, so in fact a large number of star shades for JWST could be deployed simultaneously, speeding surveys of star planetary systems. As noted in the Phase 1 report, the technology could also be used for large solar sails or habitats.",

      "description": "We propose a modular, self-assembling architecture enabling the construction of 30+ m diameter, reflective, space telescopes with active optics.  The entire structure of the telescope, including the primary and secondary mirrors, secondary support structure and planar sunshield will be constructed from a single, mass-produced spacecraft module.  Each module will be composed of a hexagonal ~1 m diameter spacecraft topped with an edge-to-edge, active mirror assembly.  The mirror will have at least thirty degrees of freedom, driven by mechanical actuators, so that the assembled primary and secondary mirrors will be fully active and can be phased and given the appropriate shape post-assembly.  Modules will be launched independently as payloads of opportunity, and navigate to the Sun-Earth L2 point using a deployable solar sail.   The solar sails will then become the planar telescope sunshield during telescope assembly, which will proceed autonomously with no additional human or robotic intervention.       The target mission concept is a large-aperture implementation of the Large Ultraviolet/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR), which has been highlighted in the NASA Astrophysics roadmap and is currently being studied for the 2020 decadal survey. In the NIAC Phase I, we propose to carry out detailed simulations of the spacecraft flight and rendezvous dynamics in order to set requirements on the solar sail area and loading, along with analyses of the mirror assembly to validate the ability to achieve the required surface figure in the assembled primary and secondary mirrors.       This proposal is directly in line with the priorities of the NASA Technology Roadmaps in Science Instruments, Observatories, and Sensor Systems and Robotics and Autonomous Systems.

The difficulty to access them imposes very expensive testing and components reliability requirements that are critical for mission functionality. We propose to demonstrate a high-performance modular space telescope utilizing NovaWurks&rsquo; HiSat interchangeable architecture. The concept enables the construction, repair, and upgrade of an optical space telescope, extending the telescope&rsquo;s lifetime and enabling multidisciplinary scientific investigations. NovaWurks&rsquo; modular architecture extends also to the payload design, enabling back-end instrument switch-outs, repairs, and upgrades. Our specific focus with this CIF is to demonstrate the benefits and performance of a <strong>C</strong>onfigurable <strong>A</strong>perture <strong>S</strong>pace <strong>T</strong>elescope, CAST. Specifically, this work proposes to grow the telescope aperture by adding and re-phasing mirror segments and evaluating their optical quality. In this CIF, we also evaluate how the telescope&rsquo;s performance drives requirements on the HiSat framework.</p><p>Starting with TRL 2 (technology concept and/or application formulated)&nbsp;we will aim to reach TLR 3 (analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept)&nbsp;in Sept 2015 by&nbsp;demonstrating a 2x2 mirror system to validate our optical model and error budget, provide strawman mechanical&nbsp;architecture and structural damping analyses, and derive future satlet-based observatory performance requirements.</p><p>CAST merges existing technology (segmented telescope architecture) with emerging technology (smartly interconnected modular spacecraft).</p> <p>A one-meter visible-wavelength space telescope with 0.1 arcsec spatial resolution can resolve 70 km-sized solar magnetic flares and sunspots, detect 15 m diameter 0.1 albedo Near Earth Objects at 0.10 AU from Earth, resolve Titan and the largest asteroids, map star-formation regions, measure transiting exoplanet atmospheres and monitor AGNs and galaxy dynamics. Such an observatory in Low Earth Orbit would have a 10cm/pixel footprint on Earth. With the retirement of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in a few years, access to a visible-wavelength sub-arcsecond imaging platform from space will be in high demand. Its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), a 6.5 m, is poised to provide 0.07 arcsec resolution at 2 microns, but it has a fixed instrument complement that is non-changeable. A segmented 1-m in space, providing 7-10x better spatial resolution that can be obtained from the ground, achieves excellent science today. Add the ability to grow the aperture for better sensitivity and this adaptive telescope concept advances numerous NASA science goals. A space-based 1-meter telescope maintains &ldquo;better than seeing&rdquo; spatial resolution out to shorter wavelengths, the ultraviolet, which has no ground-based equivalent, and for which, relaxed optical requirements (e.g. 1 arc performance) still provides new science. This is very exciting as there is a lack of a dedicated UV space telescope on NASA&rsquo;s mission portfolio for the coming decades.</p><p>We are exploring enlarging a spherical primary mirror with a spherical seconday mirror with a totally modular approach. The required correcting optics and instrumentation to co-phase and align the segments are required to conform to the modular requirement.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>How far we can grow the aperture before requiring a change in the secondary mirror&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>What FOV for each primary diameter can be corrected at the diffraction limit.</strong></li><li><strong>Trade Sensitivity vs. FOV for the design suite that shares the same radius of curvature</strong></li></ul><p>Mechanically, we will explore limitations and benefits of a hyper-segemented structure.</p><ul><li><strong>Does the structure have complex modes that real-time co-phasing algorithms are not sufficient</strong></li><li><strong>Evaluation of structural stiffness and dampening while maintaining good image quality</strong></li><li><strong>Mass estimate compatibility with satlet architecture</strong></li></ul>",

      "description": "NASA has unique non-contact precision metrology requirements for dimensionally inspecting the global position and orientation of large and highly-polished multi-segmented mirrors (in an as-installed configuration), such as those used on the James Webb Space Telescope.  SURVICE Metrology has assembled a world-class team of metrologists and optical physicists to identify and develop innovative approaches to accurately inspect the positional accuracy of mirror segments using non-contact methods.  In addition to our in-house staff of experts in metrology and optics, our team includes industry-recognized academic experts in metrology.  What is needed is the ability to accurately measure the global position and orientation of mirror segments in an as-installed configuration using non-contact means from a safe distance to allow measurements to be made with minimal risk to the asset.  SURVICE proposes to research and evaluate technologies under the Phase I effort with respect to feasibility, cost, and risk and downselect to the best candidate technology for development in a Phase II effort.    SURVICE brings demonstrated metrology systems integration success that we will apply to the subject NASA challenge.  We have multiple Phase II and Phase III success stories, have delivered custom metrology solutions.",

This includes high-precision optics used by the Department of Defense, which is a key market SURVICE will explore and exploit in Phase III commercialization efforts.    With segmented mirrors being the likely or preferred type of construction for most future large optical telescopes, there will be many opportunities to employ the SURVICE metrology solution on NASA and European telescope programs, to include the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST), and the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).<br /><br />The manufacturing of DoD, NASA, and international space program telescopes is performed by numerous Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) firms.  These firms support a broad spectrum of customers that include but are not limited to the NASA.  SURVICE has already identified both US and international partners that are interested in the proposed technology development.",
      "description": "NASA has unique non-contact precision metrology requirements for dimensionally inspecting the global position and orientation of large and highly-polished multi-segmented mirrors (in an as-installed configuration), such as those used on the James Webb Space Telescope. SURVICE Metrology has assembled a world-class team of metrologists and optical physicists to develop M-TEC, an innovative non-contact metrology solution that extends traditional deflectometry for determining reflective-surface profiles by combining pattern matching and high performance computing techniques.     In addition to our in-house staff of experts in metrology and optics, our team includes industry-recognized academic experts in metrology. Our solution has demonstrated the ability to accurately measure the global position and orientation of mirror segments in an as-installed configuration using non-contact means from a safe distance to allow measurements to be made with minimal risk to the asset. SURVICE proposes to further research and develop the technology under the Phase II effort, culminating with a fully-functional and validated prototype.",

      "description": "<p>We propose to extend the development of Next Generation of Microshutter array (NGMSA), producing a scalable, electrically operable arrays that will be suitable for flight applications. Providing high contrast (&gt;=10,000), the microshutter array is the only solution for multi-object selection for space telescopes for UV spectroscopy, and can be a powerful tool for visible astronomy. The microshutter arrays developed for James Webb Space Telescope (JWST MSA) are magnetically actuated, providing 100 times of increase in instrument efficiency over single slit object selection, but cannot practically be scaled to the larger sizes required for future missions. Our NGMSAs are electrially actuated, allowing much simpler operation which open a path to large scale mosaics that are required for many proposed missions. A NGMSA mosaic can cover such a large field of view, providing a factor of 5000 increase in instrument efficiency over single slit instruments for redshift surveys. We are in the third year of an APRA-funded program for the basic development of these devices. We have successfully reached the proposed project milestone: we have demonstrated NGMSA 2-dimensional electrical addressing, opening the path to large arrays. PIs of three Explorer-Class mission concepts plan to include NGMSA as their multi-objector selector in their proposals following successful demonstration at full format. The extension of the NGMSA project will allow us to advance the technology to high TRL levels to be ready for these flight missions. We suggest the following reviewers for this effort: Chris Martin (Caltech), James Green (University of Colorado, Boulder), and Oswald Siegmund (University of California, Berkeley).</p>",

      "description": "In a shared effort of advancing our scientific understanding of planets, stars, and galaxies, space agencies and astronomical centers have been building increasingly large telescopes. These observatories allow us to collect more light and extend angular resolution to detect fainter objects in the cosmos. While ground-based telescopes are fundamentally limited by atmospheric distortion and absorption, space-based telescopes avoid these disadvantages but introduce new challenges. The aperture size of a space-telescope is driven by scientific requirements for resolution and sensitivity, but it is constrained by the capabilities of launch vehicles. Segmented apertures relax some of the volume constraint, but a natural question is whether the primary should be a single large foldable mirror structure (like James Webb Space Telescope), or a modular structure suitable for in-space robotic assembly. The second option, which will be investigated in this research, overcomes volume and mass limitations of a single launch vehicle, allowing telescope components to be launched incrementally.    The goal of my research project is to provide ground-breaking designs for modular, ultra-light, and precision space structures, suitable for the development of extremely large optical reflectors (i.e. 10 m and above) that are robotically assembled in space. There are three main advantages related to this proposed approach: first, substantially reducing the cost of building large space optical reflectors by developing new and less expensive solutions, second, implementing a lightweight technology by utilizing ultra-thin composite materials, and third, increasing system redundancy by adopting an architecture that consists of separate modules that can be replaced.    There are many steps involved in the design of innovative structures. Here, I identify the four main tasks required to complete the proposed research: numerical simulations, material characterization, composite manufacturing, and testing and validation. Numerical simulations will help identify optimal design configurations and predict possible failure modes of the modular unit. Material characterization will be necessary to study the viscoelastic effects of long-term storage. Finally, manufacturing and testing of the modules will complete the design process and help find solutions.    The modular unit promises to meet NASA's requirements for packaging-efficient, lightweight, low-cost, reliable, and precision structures, by incorporating established techniques and ground-breaking approaches. The success of this project will help in achieving NASA's goals for future space exploration by developing low technology readiness concepts and enabling large space-based observatories.",

      "benefits": "The Astrophysics Research and Analysis program (APRA) supports suborbital and suborbital-class investigations, development of detectors and supporting technology, laboratory astrophysics, and limited ground based observing. Basic research proposals in these areas are solicited for investigations that are relevant to NASA's programs in astronomy and astrophysics, including the entire range of photons, gravitational waves, and particle astrophysics. The emphasis of this solicitation is on technologies and investigations that advance NASA astrophysics missions and goals.",
      "description": "Advances in detector technologies have time and time again helped us to radically improve our understanding of the Universe. An example of this is seen in the progression of our knowledge of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) through improved detector technology. NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) generated the first maps of the CMB, providing evidence for black-body distribution. It also detected several previously unknown far-infrared emitting galaxies. Further detector improvements on Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP, 2001) and ESA's Planck spacecraft (2009) gave increasingly detailed maps of density and distribution of matter in the universe and a higher precision measurement of the age of the universe. The upcoming James Webb Space Telescope will give unprecedented information of the time just after recombination, yielding insights into star and galaxy formation. These improvements in detector technology have proven immanently useful in the fields of astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology.  The vast majority of photons in the universe are in the millimeter and submillimeter wavelength ranges. These photons carry clues to many of our most profound questions set out in NASA's astrophysics roadmap: “Are we alone?,” “How did we get here?,” and “How does the universe work?” Bolometric detectors remain the state-of-the-art (SOA) for space-based studies, but creating large arrays is challenging with this technology. The NIKA2 Camera installed at Pico Veleta represents the current Earth-based SOA for continuum detector technology, utilizing highly sensitive kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). KIDs typically give a NEP performance of E-17~E-18 W/√Hz with beneficial multiplexing capabilities, something not possible with the previous SOA bolometric detectors. This capability generates a convenient platform for large arrays of detectors. Ongoing improvements to KIDs are eminent, with SuperSpec KIDs and SRON's SPACEKIDS achieving E-19 W√Hz. While KIDs clearly have offered a path forward towards improved sensitivity with multiplexing capabilities, there are known challenges associated with these detectors. Missions such as Origins Space Telescope (OST) or Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVIOR) would benefit from the advancement of an alternative technology to ensure that mission success is not fully reliant on a single technology that is not yet fully developed.  An alternative technological solution to highly sensitive Far-IR detection would greatly help mitigate mission risk and offer an independent path to mission success.    We propose to implement an array of resonant detectors sensitive to a broad range of spectra from UV to far-IR with ultralow-noise performance with frequency multiplexing capability. The frequency of the detectors shifts proportional to the amount of absorbed radiation power. Each pixel of the detector array is composed of an acoustic resonator with ultra-high quality factor in the order of E5. The pixels exhibit slightly different resonance frequencies defined by optical lithography processes. To improve sensitivity, the temperature coefficient of frequency of these detectors can be engineered to be >100 ppm/K. When operated at typical low temperatures (<300mK) to limit thermal noise, their Qs become even higher generating further improvements in the NEP. Thus, depending on the application, they can be cooled to any temperature to meet the science need, with expected achievable NEP values of E-18 W√Hz at 60mK.  Nanofabrication and multiplexing allows integration of thousands of pixels to form a large imaging array. These detectors combine the detection principles of resonant bolometers with the frequency multiplexing capabilities of KIDs, generating an independent and alternative detector technology with existing infrastructure.",

      "description": "One of the pressing needs for space ultraviolet-visible astronomy is a design to allow larger mirrors than the James Webb Space Telescope primary. The diameter of the rocket fairing limits the mirror diameter such that all future missions calling for mirrors up to 16 m in diameter or larger will require a mirror that is deployed post-launch. In response to the deployment requirement, we address the issues of this concept called \"A Precise Extremely large Reflective Telescope Using Reconfigurable Elements (APERTURE) with both hardware experiments and software simulations. APERTURE will use a deployable membrane-like mirror. The mirror figure will be corrected after deployment to bring it into better or equal lambda/20 deviations from the prescribed mirror shape, where lambda (typically 400 nm-1 micron) is the operational wavelength. Instead of using the classical piezoelectric-patch technology, our concept is based on a continuous coating of a Magnetic Smart Material (MSM). We expect that the initially deployed mirror will not have a perfect figure. Thus our design uses magnetic write heads to produce stress in the MSM and improve the figure, post deployment. This Phase II NIAC proposal is to address two of the tall poles in the concept: (a) Can corrections on a large size be made and retained for a long enough time (> 1 week); (b) Can deployment be done in such a way that the figures corrections are small enough to be correctable via the MSM plus magnetic field, and at the same time, the in plane stresses as small enough to allow the stresses resulting magnetic field injected into the MSM plus magnetic fields to make the necessary corrections. Tall pole “a” will be primarily the responsibility of Northwestern University (NU) and “b” of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. NU will carry out overall scientific leadership and will coordinate and solicit input from GSFC, JPL, and NIST.",

      "description": "<p>We propose a four year suborbital-class research program to develop, launch, and operate the Astrophysics Research Testbed and UV Emission Mapping Imaging Spectrograph (ARTEMIS): a 6U CubeSat that will address two key questions in astronomy: How do galaxies provide ionizing radiation to the IGM? The transition from a neutral to an ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) was one of the key milestones in cosmic structure formation. Finding the ionizing sources - galaxies and AGN - is a central goal of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), but even this flagship cannot solve one critical aspect of the problem: How much of this radiation actually escapes galaxies to reionize the IGM? Webb cannot detect the ionizing radiation itself through the opaque high-z IGM, so users will instead use redshifted UV/optical emission lines as proxies. These proxies must be calibrated with direct measurements of ionizing radiation escape in a sample of galaxies at lower redshift. ARTEMIS will directly measure the ionizing spectrum in 100 0.15 < z < 0.3 galaxies and AGN, a sample that will surpass in number and precision all ionizing escape measurements to date and provide critical interpretive tools for core JWST science. What controls the mass, energy and chemical flows within galaxies? OB stars dominate the ionization and kinematic drivers of galactic disks through their intense radiation, fast stellar winds, and metal dispersal in supernovae; but how do these processes interact to drive the evolution of galaxies? ARTEMIS will trace feedback in its earliest stages using unique far-UV diagnostics (FUV: 1000 - 1600 angstroms) and a novel spectral imaging observing mode to create multi-dimensional data cube maps of more than 50 local star forming regions and supernova remnants in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. This survey will quantify the physics of radiative and kinetic energy injection into their host galaxies and provide ground-truth to sub-grid physical models in hydrodynamical simulations. ARTEMIS is designed to carry out these astrophysically compelling spectral surveys while serving as a demonstration testbed for the LUVOIR Surveyor - maturing and flight-qualifying technology identified as Priority One needs in the 2017 NASA Cosmic Origins Program Annual Technology Report. The advanced optical coatings and next-generation photon-counting microchannel plate (MCP) detector in the ARTEMIS design represent a paradigm shift for astronomy in the FUV, enabling more optical elements and exceptionally low on-orbit backgrounds without the crippling throughput losses that would occur with conventional technologies. Our extensive on-orbit calibration program will provide critical in situ measurements of their stability and performance ahead of formal adoption by LUVOIR, HabEx, or other NASA Large-, Probe-, or Explorer-class missions. ARTEMIS will leverage these recent products of the APRA, SAT and Roman Technology Fellowship programs to achieve sensitivities comparable to or exceeding previous FUV Explorer-class missions in a CubeSat envelope. The ARTEMIS instrument is comprised of a rectangular Cassegrain telescope feeding a compact, low resolution (R ~ 1500) imaging spectrograph. The science instrument is incorporated into a Blue Canyon Technologies spacecraft bus that provides power, command and data handling, attitude control, and communications. Calibration and testing will occur in existing University of Colorado (CU) UV space-instrument facilities alongside other NASA SMD missions. ARTEMIS will be developed in the framework of CU's student-led space sciences program, where undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral training is paramount.</p> ",

Thus, each of these programs conduct strategic technology development activities to enable future missions and to support early phase mission development. Each has a formal Technology Development Plan to guide its technology development activities, and maintains an annual report that documents the status of currently funded activities. Annual assessments identify future technology development needs based on the science goals of each program.</p><p>The PCOS, COR, and EXEP Programs conduct competed technology development efforts through a Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science (ROSES) element known as Strategic Astrophysics Technology (SAT) that specifically targets technology developments that bridge the technology readiness level (TRL) 3-6 gap. SAT developed technologies are essential to enable strategic missions that specifically address the key science goals of the Astrophysics Decadal Survey recommendations. The three SAT elements for PCOS, COR, and EXEP are named Technology Development for Physics of the Cosmos (TPCOS), Technology Development for Cosmic Origins Program (TCOP), and Technology Development for Exo-Planet Missions (TDEM) respectively. In contrast to these competed efforts, each program also conducts directed technology development activities that are carried out as elements of specific strategic science missions during early development phases.</p><p>The Astrophysics Research Program competitively solicits low TRL (1-3) technology development activities of a more general nature through the Astrophysics Research and Analysis (APRA) Program element of ROSES.

      "description": "Understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies over cosmic time is one of the foremost goals of astrophysics and cosmology today. The cosmic star formation rate has undergone a dramatic evolution over the course of the last 14 billion years, and dust-obscured star forming galaxies (DSFGs) are a crucial component of this evolution. A variety of important, bright, and unextincted diagnostic lines are present in the far-infrared (FIR) which can provide crucial insight into the physical conditions of galaxy evolution, including the instantaneous star formation rate, the effect of AGN feedback on star formation, the mass function of the stars, metallicities, and the spectrum of their ionizing radiation. FIR spectroscopy is technically difficult but scientifically crucial. The FIR waveband is impossible to observe from the ground, and spans a crucial gap in the spectroscopic coverage between the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the sub/mm, and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the mid-IR. Stratospheric balloons offer a platform which can outperform current instrument sensitivities and are the only way to provide large-area, wide-bandwidth spatial/spectral mapping at FIR wavelengths. We propose an aggressive program of instrumentation development and experimental study called the Spectroscopic Terahertz Airborne Receiver for Far-InfraRed Exploration (STARFIRE), with the goal of demonstrating the key technical milestones necessary for FIR spectroscopy. STARFIRE will provide a technological stepping stone to the future space-borne instrumentation such as the Origins Space Telescope (OST, formerly the Far-IR Surveyor) or a Probe mission. STARFIRE will address the two key technical issues necessary to achieve this: 1) Low-emissivity, high-throughput telescope and spectrometer optics for the FIR; 2) Background-limited detectors in large format arrays, scalable to >10,000 pixels. We will do this by constructing an integral-field spectrometer from 240 - 420 microns coupled to a 2-meter low-emissivity carbon-fiber telescope. The development of the optics will utilize the capabilities of the Arizona Steward Observatory mirror lab and the unique expertise of our spectroscopic experts to create high-throughput optics. For the detectors, we will leverage the highly advanced development work of the Caltech / JPL group to develop and field kinetic-inductance detectors (KIDs). KIDs represent the most promising route to economical, large format submillimeter detector arrays. In addition to the development and demonstration of crucial technologies for the FIR, STARFIRE will perform groundbreaking science. We will survey two 0.1 square degree fields centered on GOODS-S and the South Pole Telescope Deep Field, both of which have rich ancillary data. Scientifically, we will: 1) Obtain spectroscopic line detections of ~100 galaxies in the atomic fine structure lines [CII](158 microns) (at 0.5",

We propose to supply the astronomical community with theoretical and experimental spectra of a wide range of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and PAH clusters and to use our IR absorption spectra to calculate emission spectra that will be crucial in interpreting the new observational data.  The Infrared Space Observatory and Spitzer Space Telescopes have shown that the mid-IR emission spectrum of the interstellar medium is dominated by strong bands at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3 and 12.7 microns superimposed upon broad underlying plateaus generally attributed to PAHs, PAH clusters and very small grains. Despite the limited spectral and spatial resolution of these data, detailed analysis has revealed that each band is, in fact, a blend of multiple emission features. Subtle variations in the band blending can be detected even for spectra measured at different positions within a single astronomical source. These variations can be seen to arise from multiple PAH and PAH-related carriers that are each responding differently to the local physical conditions. The James Webb Space Telescope has near-IR and mid-IR instruments, NIRSpec and MIRI, with an extremely high spectral resolution, spatial resolution, and sensitivity that will revolutionize infrared astronomy. These instruments will provide spatial maps on a sub-arcsecond scale with an unprecedented level of spectral detail, allowing detailed study of the interrelationship of the individual components within each emission band. This will provide a critical insight into the molecular characteristics of the emitting species and their (photo)chemical evolution in space.  Exploitation of these astronomical spectra requires fundamental data on potential emitting species that fully account for all astrophysically relevant materials. Over the last two decades, spectra of neutral and charged PAHs have been calculated using quantum theory. Due to computational limitations, this data set is biased towards smaller or highly symmetric species. In addition, continued analysis of the mid-IR emission bands by several recent Spitzer studies, has demonstrated that PAHs and PAH clusters with less symmetric structures containing “bay regions” are more important for understanding the IR emission bands than had previously been realized. The currently available infrared data set on less symmetric PAHs and PAH clusters is insufficient to exploit the astronomical data.  Advances in computing power now allow spectra for a much wider range of species to be calculated. In support of the analysis of Spitzer data and the upcoming JWST mission, we therefore propose to calculate the 3-20 micron spectra of isolated as well as clustered neutral and charged PAHs containing up to 150 carbon atoms and with a wide range of compact structures and eroded structures with irregular shapes containing “bay regions”, “coves”, and “fjords”. These theoretical data will be validated by a dedicated laboratory study of PAH species and their clusters. These IR absorption spectra will be used to calculate emission spectra that can be directly compared to existing astronomical observations and that will be used to guide our quantum chemical and experimental studies on relevant species for support of Early Release Science proposals for JWST.",

Advanced x-ray telescopes such as GenX, using nested Wolter &#150; Type 1 designs will require thousands of thin shell mirror segments produced by replication using convex mandrels. Scientific instruments aboard these telescope payloads will certainly include optical components and structures that will drive further advancements in manufacturing technology. The technical effort proposed here has clear potential to benefit these and other future space astronomy programs by improving the performance and lowering the cost of precision optical components.",
      "description": "Advanced x-ray observatories such as IXO and GenX will require thousands of thin shell mirror segments produced by replication using convex mandrels. Quality and cost effective manufacturing of these segments is proportional to the speed and effectiveness of the metrology we use in manufacturing and the ability to use accurate measurements to enable deterministic fabrication. AOS proposes development of an efficient and accurate metrology system to enable the manufacturing of sements with performance of 0.5 arc-second or better. A curent  method to test such mandrels is to stitch multiple meridional profiles acquired using a large aperture plano interferometer and an air-bearing actuated partholder. AOS will advance this method, by building an automated platform, driven by custom developed software, and implementing improvements that will enhance both the accuracy and efficiency of the test.",

      "description": "The size and accuracy specifications of telescope mirrors are ever more demanding.  This is particularly true for secondary mirrors, as they are convex and thus require large-aperture optics to test them.  Recent NASA programs, such as the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), include monolithic secondary mirrors of significant size (larger than half a meter).  Secondary mirrors of such large sizes are difficult and expensive to test due to the large-aperture converging and nulling optics required.  Furthermore, calibration of these optics to the level required for next-generation programs is extremely challenging.  Subaperture stitching has the potential to provide accurate high-resolution maps of large-aperture aspheric optics without the use of even larger aperture optics or dedicated nulls.  QED's Subaperture Stitching Interferometer (SSI<SUP>REG</SUP>) has achieved nanometer-level accuracies on spherical optics with its novel compensation techniques.  Non-null capability is enhanced since the individual subapertures have significantly less aspheric departure.  However, the system is currently only capable of testing up to 280 mm optics of mild asphericity.  Phase I work demonstrated that the technology is scalable to larger aperture sizes.  This proposal focuses on innovations for leveraging the considerable benefits of stitching (high resolution, automatic calibration, and flexible aspheric testing) to aspheric optics.  Activities will include uncertainty analyses of aspheric tests, subscale measurement demonstrations, and development of concepts for testing larger amounts of aspheric departure.",

      "benefits": "<p>This instrument will increase Goddard's expertise in Infrared (IR) instrument development with applications to astronomy and Earth Science. The technology developments required for this instrument will cross over to a number of other fields including nadir sounders for planetary and Earth science, as well as astronomy. IR sensing technology has been under intense development over the last decade with innovations developed for the military and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and gives us the advantage of high vertical resolution without sacrificing single profile precision. This instrument will be taking advantage of a new class of commercial off the shelf high resolution imaging shortwave (SW)IR, midwave (MW)IR and thermal IR detectors along with compact coolers. The technology development will potentially include dual focal plane design and limb-view correcting optics. The ALICE mission will address high-impact scientific problems related to global air quality, constituent transport in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere, dehydration processes in the tropical tropopause layer, and lead to a better understanding of gravity waves. ALICE measurements would also continue NASA's profile measurements of stratospheric ozone and constituents important to ozone chemistry, with comprehensive measurements since the launch of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) in 1991 and sporadic missions back to the late 1970s and help fulfill NASA's congressional mandate to monitor and report on the ozone layer.</p> ",
      "description": "<p>This project is to develop a mission/instrument concept in response to the 2017 Decadal Survey. The Advanced Limb Infrared Chemistry Experiment (ALICE) is an infrared limb scanner (wavelengths ~3-15 µm), which will measure important tropospheric and stratospheric constituents (including O<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, HNO<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>2</sub>, CFCs, clouds, temperature, and aerosols) with ~1 km vertical resolution from the mid-troposphere to the upper-stratosphere. This unique data set will allow us to observe and quantify transport between the troposphere and stratosphere, characterize the chemical composition of the climate-sensitive upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere, and continue our long-term stratospheric record.</p> ",

      "description": "<p>The field of view required for future missions is much larger than James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We need to use electrostatic actuation to replace magnetic actuation, so that Next Generation Microshutter arrays (NGMSA) can be scalable to cover large field of view of future telescopes. Our ultimate goal is to develop an extendable electrostatic actuated microshutter array system anticipating the Explorers and other future flight missions in the next two decades. The development of Electrostatic Actuated Next Generation Microshutter Array (EA- NGMSA) as a multi-object field selector for the proposed Explorer Class Missions. This field selector will improve instrument efficiency by up to three orders of magnitude, providing large improvements in performance for optical and UV telescopes, as well as IR systems.<p/><p>We have recently demonstrated electrostatic actuation using electrostatic force to create a concept of an electrically addressable microshutter array. This is a crucial breakthrough which opens the path to a very large focal plane field selectors.  We will further investigate an electrostatic actuation mechanism to reduce actuation voltage and to simplify the actuation process. Electrostatic actuation is critical to enabling MSA actuation and maintaining robust reliable devices. Besides the demonstration of electrostatic actuation of the microshutters, we demonstrated 2-D addressing of the shutters in a NGMSA array. Shutters can be randomly selected open, latch, hold and released close. The development already brought us a ROSES-APRA support (2011-2014 & 2015-2017).</p>",

      "description": "Peregrines innovation will reduce the required input power, increase a coolers systems margin for a giving cooling load and reduce vibration accordingly for Cryocoolers.  Our innovation will enhance the thermal conductivities of structures associated with the cryocooler, enable much more efficient heat removal and thereby produce a more efficient system.  Effectively we will be increasing the thermal conductivities of the structures associated with the Cryocoolers by embedding Thermal Pyrolytic Graphite within a matrix of material to produce a thermal conductivity 5 times higher than current available materials.  As cryocooler technologies attempt to cool components down around the 4<SUP>o</SUP>K level, waste heat and the management thereof becomes critical to the performance of the cryocooler.  Thermal conductivity structures made from our innovation possessing a thermal conductivity of 700 W/mK will eliminate thermal loads more effectively and will lead to a more efficient and better performing cryocooler.  Phase I has proven feasibility, Phase II will development and demonstrate our innovation resulting in a flight component for the MIRI cooling system for the James Webb Space Telescope.   ",

Some land-based telescope systems would include the GSMT, Euro 50, OWL, and Kelt, programs.  DoD systems currently identified that would have a keen interest in this technology would include the Predator, MKV, EKV, and ADLT systems, among others.  The technology developed during this program would be applicable for the rapid production of any large aperture, lightweight, high performance, low cost, SiC optical mirrors for a wide variety of applications.  NASA uses would include virtually all land, air or space based systems.  It is possible that the technology could be applied to the James Webb telescope, but the timing is likely to lag the desired schedule for that particular system.  Other NASA programs in the areas of grazing incidence X-ray, visible, UV-EUV, and solar facing optical systems could also take advantage of the technology developed during this program.",
      "description": "The following proposal summarizes the process by which Trex Enterprises will utilize our patented CVC (Chemical Vapor Composite) SiC process towards the fabrication of near net shape lightweight SiC mirrors with high optical performance for both the surface figure and surface roughness of the as-deposited mirror.  The as-deposited surface figure and roughness will be optimized through careful selection and preparation processes applied to a variety of mandrel structures and designs.  The CVC process replicates the current mandrel surface precisely and this work will look to explore and quantify optically the absolute limits of the surface replication potential of the CVC process. Once this surface has been characterized and optimized, we will then be in a position to either move directly to polishing or eliminate the polishing stage completely from our mirror fabrication process.  The savings in both time and cost would greatly improve both the cost of high performance SiC optics as well as reduce the long lead time from many months to as little as several weeks.",

      "description": "The leading cause of spacecraft failures and malfunctions due to interactions with the space plasma environment is electrostatic discharge (ESD). The enhanced time to ESD model I propose will allow for better predictions of spacecraft lifetimes and reduce the time and effort needed to obtain them. Spacecraft in the space plasma environment accumulate charge over time, the lack of electrical ground and low charge mobility can cause strong localized electric fields to build up in a material that can eventually lead to catastrophic breakdown. As spacecraft with longer mission lifetimes and more sensitive instruments are proposed, it becomes increasingly more important to be able to predict the operational lifetime of materials used in harsh space environments. My research will be to perform material tests in order to develop an enhanced ESD breakdown model.    The Utah State University Materials Physics Group (MPG) has studied the charge transport properties of spacecraft materials in partnership with NASA facilities including Goddard and Marshall Space Flight Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Air Force Research Laboratory. As part of my participation with the James Webb Space Telescope project, I have studied ESD properties of relevant spacecraft materials. I propose to continue my research in order to develop predictions of ESD, based on descriptions of microscopic defect populations in common spacecraft materials. Of particular interest are spacecraft insulators such as polymeric low density polyethylene, polyimide (KaptonTM), and polytetraflourethylene (TeflonTM) as well as ceramics and glasses such as Al2O3 and disordered SiO2 and potential novel nanodielectrics and metamaterials.  We have identified different defect species in these materials that affect their breakdown behaviors. These defects include thermally-recoverable low-energy defects and irrecoverable defects associated with energetically deep trap sites.   My proposed tests are more applicable to spacecraft technology than standard breakdown tests. Dielectric breakdown strengths cited in handbooks or by manufactures most often come from ASTM standard tests that very rapidly ramp applied voltage until breakdown occurs. These tests are not very repeatable and do not reflect slower charge accumulation rates experienced by spacecraft in the space plasma environment. The MPG ESD test system typically use <1% of these rates, with very repeatable results. For spacecraft charging considerations, it is more useful to talk about how long a material can endure a sub-critical fields before eventual breakdown. The MPG ESD test system is capable of holding samples at sub-critical voltages to observe time to breakdown.   My previous experimental work with ESD and time endurance ESD tests has demonstrated differences in pre-breakdown arcing behavior and post-breakdown transport modes between polymeric and glassy materials. These differences reflect differences in intrinsic and induced material defects. My project will entail further experimental work to confirm differences in density and species of defects in different materials and to relate these explicitly to average times to breakdown under field stress. Critical to the development of this model is the understanding of pre-breakdown arcing in terms of the creation and annihilation of recoverable defect sites and the creation of irrecoverable defects. I will extend the MPG time model in terms of these dual defect modes to predict the time to ESD breakdown of insulating materials across differences in temperature, applied field, and thickness as a function of material defect populations. I will test my model against the MPG spacecraft materials database of ESD measurements and MPG constant voltage conductivity and pulsed electro-acoustic charge transport measurements.",

      "description": "The proposed innovation is a motor-control subsystem capable of operation in extreme environments, including those to be encountered on the Moon and Mars. Specifically, we will demonstrate operation over the environmental range from +130ºC down to -230ºC during Phase 1, and from +200ºC down to -230ºC during Phase 2. The switching transistors for the controller will be based on silicon-germanium (SiGe) because of its demonstrated ability to operate well at extreme temperatures. The outcome of this project will be an operating hardware system, not a simulation. This innovation will be applicable to upcoming NASA missions to the surface of the Moon and Mars, as well as to other missions that need controllers for motors and actuators operating directly in extreme environments. Motor-control systems are also needed for space-based observatories, for example for the deformable cryogenic optical systems on the James Webb Space Telescope. Moreover, there are potential applications for extreme-temperature power electronics in the industrial, commercial and defense sectors.  The Phase 1 demonstration target is an H-bridge control circuit, pulse-width modulated, for controlling the speed and direction of a 20 W dc motor. The circuit will incorporate four silicon-germanium (SiGe) HBTs, because of their demonstrated advantages for extreme-temperature operation.  In addition, the proposing organization, GPD Optoelectronics Corp., has developed SiGe power transistors that operate down to -230ºC. The drive circuitry will use optoelectronic coupling.  Suitable packaging technologies for the extreme environment will be developed and reliability testing will be performed. A complete prototype system will be delivered at the conclusion of each Phase. The proposed motor-control subsystem is an innovation because there are presently no such subsystems capable of operation over the extreme-environment range from +130ºC or +200ºC down to -230ºC.  ",

      "description": "A potential follow-on to the James Webb Space Telescope is a Large Ultraviolet-Optical  Infrared (LUVOIR) space telescope with an aperture in the range of 10-12m or larger.  LUVOIR would conduct a spectroscopic survey for evidence of life in potential habitable earth-like planets, and provide an observatory for ground-breaking astrophysical programs.  A 10-12 m class UVOIR observatory has been recommended by  AURA's Beyond JWST committee in presentations made to the AAS. In considering the key technology challenges  of such a mission, it is important to point out that the survey of earth-like candidates requires high contrast (10^10) combined with small Inner Working Angle (IWA) coronagraphs (2 L/D) , and the ability to survey hundreds of G and K type stars during the mission lifetime (Stark et al. 2014).  To achieve this level of contrast, the observatory will need to efficiently achieve stability levels across the primary mirror less than 10 picometers for up to 10 minutes (Redding et al, 2014).  Our team has shown through modeling that meeting the stability requirement of lightweight mirror segments of 1.2m diameter lightweight hexagonal shape Ultra Low Expansion (ULE) mirrors is feasible using achievable thermal control approaches at room temperature with 1 milli-Kelvin level thermal control and work is ongoing to assess mirror level thermal stability. However, another key capability required to enable this level of system performance is achieving segment to segment stability (Feinberg, et al 2014), which is driven by the mirror support structures (if each segment is already stabilized with an appropriate thermal control system).   Therefore, our team proposes an approach that combines improved composite materials and structures, innovative mirror mounting, active thermal strategies, and optical measurement methods to demonstrate a segment to segment thermal and dynamic stability of 10 picometers over up to 10 minutes on a subscale system.  The composite material improvements are in reduced moisture absorption effects (CME) and CTE based on nanotechnology.  To achieve this, we will leverage etalon based coupon level test methods developed by the LISA community, high speed interferometry dynamic and electronic speckle pattern interferometry for thermal stability metrology developed by the JWST community.   This work will provide an alternative (and potentially more robust method) for building dimensionally stable systems for precision measurements such as detection gravitational waves.",

This program is specifically designed to address middle technology readiness level (TRL) \"gaps\" between levels 3 and 6: the maturation of technologies that have been established as feasible, but which are not yet sufficiently mature to incorporate into flight missions without introducing an unacceptable level of risk. NASA does not require a data management plan for proposals to SAT.",
      "description": "Multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) is a technology development priority of the Cosmic Origins Program. Aperture control methods that are popular in ground-based MOS applications (e.g., robotically configured fibers and punch plates) are not practical options for spaceflight. Microshutter array technology solves this problem. A microshutter array functions as a slit mask that can be programmed to provide any pattern of slits corresponding to sparsely distributed sources on the sky. It can also be programed to provide shaped slits on extended sources. Our first generation micro-shutter technology enabled realization of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSpec). This prior technology involved a combination of electrostatic and magnetic actuation that results in a heavy complex mechanical assembly that does not scale to larger formats required by strategic mission concepts that are under study for the 2020 Decadal Survey. Our Next Generation MicroShutter Array (NGMSA) technology eliminates the magnetic actuation aspect as well as the mechanical complexity and mass associated with it. The result is a simple low mass shutter array that is scalable to very large formats with no life-limited mechanical components. This major breakthrough has been demonstrated to TRL-4 in small 128 x 64 pixel arrays of 200 x 100 micron shutter pixels under prior APRA and GSFC internal investment funding. A prototype of this small format is in testing for space flight on a sounding rocket that is expected to launch during spring of 2019. This proposal requests support to advance the above NGMSA state of art to a 840 x 420 pixel three side buttable format to support strategic mission applications discussed below. The 840 x 420 format NGMSA is an enabling technology for the Large UltraViolet Optical InfraRed surveyor (LUVOIR), the Habitable Exoplanet surveyor (HabEx) strategic missions, and the Cosmic Evolution Through UV Spectroscopy (CETUS) probe-class mission concept studies that are being developed by the Cosmic Origins Program. Each of these mission concept studies have incorporated large format NGMSAs into their study baseline. Micro-shutters remain the only low complexity option for enabling high (>10^5) contrast MOS for spaceflight applications. The wide range of Decadal Survey mission concept studies that are designing around the NGMSA illustrate the broad science pull for advancing the readiness of this technology to meet National science priorities for astrophysics in the next decade. In this proposal, we request support for a tightly focused three year project to bring the 840 X 420 three side buttable NGMSA array from TRL-3 to TRL-5 and to produce two element mosaic assemblies of these arrays tested to TRL-5, to enable MOS science requirements of the above mission concept studies. This proposal team includes collaborators from each of these mission studies to insure alignment with their respective \"pull technology\" requirements. In order to lend efficacy to evaluation of the LUVOIR, HabEx, and CETUS mission concept studies by the 2020 Decadal Survey, it is imperative that maturation of the 840 x 420 mosaic building block array be approved on this SAT solicitation cycle.",

      "description": "<p>Interstellar dust-grain surfaces are the site of the formation of some of the most important interstellar molecules, such as H2, H2O, CH3OH (methanol), and a range of more complex organic species. This grain-surface chemistry results in the build-up of thick ice mantles around the grains. The accurate interpretation of infrared ice absorption-line data from past instruments such as Spitzer and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope depends on an understanding of the chemical and physical structure of the ices, as well as their chemical composition. Simulations of dust-grain chemical kinetics provide the bridge between laboratory experiment and space-based infrared observations. However, most simulations of grain-surface and ice chemistry include minimal structural information; averaged chemical reaction rates are used to follow the evolution of chemical abundances, but the exact positions of individual atoms and molecules cannot be traced by such means. While these simple methods are necessary for simulations of environments that are dynamically variable, they can never be used to predict or explain microscopic ice structure and the chemical and observational implications flowing therefrom. Here, a new off-lattice Monte Carlo chemical kinetic model of dust grain-surface chemistry will be used to trace the motions of individual atoms and molecules on the grain surfaces, allowing a precise picture of ice formation, structure and composition. Published preliminary models have demonstrated the feasibility of the project. The model allows the size, shape, and structure of the underlying grain to be specified, atom-by-atom. The model calculates local potential minima on the fly, as surface diffusion occurs; thus the ice forming on the grain surface is not limited to a pre-determined structure, and ice structures build up naturally, based on physical principles. Ray-traced videos can be used to visualize the developing dust-grain ice. The possibilities for investigation include: the degree of porosity in interstellar and laboratory ices; the influence of differing grain sizes, shapes, and surface topologies on grain chemistry; chemical segregation of the ices into polar/apolar components; and the reproduction and parameterization of laboratory ice-chemistry experiments. The new simulation method will be critical to our full understanding of the interaction between interstellar surface chemistry, ice structure, grain morphology, and gas-phase abundances.</p>",

      "description": "We propose to develop commercially available digital micromirror devices (DMDs) for use in the far ultraviolet (FUV) and near ultraviolet (NUV) regimes of 100 nm – 400 nm, using recently developed FUV mirror coatings. DMDs can be used as rapidly reconfigurable “slit mask” object-selectors in space-based UV multi object spectrometers (MOS). Currently, DMDs are the only alternative to microshutter arrays, which were developed for the infrared MOS on the James Webb Space Telescope. The need for an efficient UV MOS has been identified as a Priority 1 Technological Gap by the general community, according to the Cosmic Origins 2016 Program Annual Technology Report. There are several missions currently in the planning process, which are developing concepts for multi-object spectrometers. For example both LUVOIR and HabEx plan to include such an instrument, working into the UV. Several smaller dedicated spectroscopic survey missions based around a highly multiplexed spectrometer have also been proposed. The choice of slit selector for such instruments is limited. While microshutter arrays are currently viewed as the frontrunner, the previous generation of microshutters has limitations and the next generation is still in early development. We have worked extensively on space qualification of the Texas Instruments DMDs and have shown the current generation of these devices to be ideal for space applications. However the deep UV (100 nm -300 nm) reflectivity of such devices needs to be substantially higher. We will re-coat commercially available DMDs (which use aluminum alloy mirrors) with high reflectivity aluminum, which is protected by an overcoat using recently developed FUV-enhanced thin films (LiF and AlF3). These protected aluminum coatings were developed to have a high reflectivity in the FUV range of 100 nm – 300 nm by two recent SAT projects. This work will build on our own previous SAT-funded efforts to determine the usability of DMDs in space and to extend their use into the NUV range of 200 nm – 400 nm. As part of this work we will produce re-coated DMDs with a high reflectivity in the FUV (with and without a protective window) and investigate the susceptibility of these devices to damage due to long exposures to highly energetic FUV photons. DMDs that operate in the FUV range will provide an alternative to microshutter arrays and help close a critical technology gap in FUV/NUV astronomy.",

With the proposed solid electrolyte material, a highly stable and safe Li-ion battery can be developed that meets NASA's high energy density (greater than 500 Wh/kg, C/10) requirements at operating temperature of T=0 to 100 degrees centigrade.",
      "description": "We propose to develop an all solid state Li-ion battery which is capable of delivering high energy density, combined with high safety over a wide operating temperature range. The proposed effort builds upon an in-house developed inorganic solid electrolyte that has demonstrated high ionic conductivity at room temperature (1.5x10-2 S/cm). The primary objective of the Phase I program is to demonstrate that the recently invented solid electrolyte can be formulated into a useable form in a practical Li-ion battery, and that traditional challenges associated with the use of a solid electrolyte can be overcome. A key innovation is the use of a unique composite morphology for the solid electrolyte, wherein passive components, such as the binder and separator, are replaced by an active conductive electrolyte network. The proposed new solid electrolyte will fully eliminate the flammability issues of conventional Li-ion batteries, thereby leading to a safer device with high thermal and mechanical stability. The target energy density for the proposed solid electrolyte based Li-ion cell at the cell level are: greater than 500Wh/kg (gravimetric) and 2700 Wh/l (volumetric), while maintaining 80% of initial capacity after 500 cycles under full depth of discharge. The Phase I effort entails fabrication of the proposed composite solid electrolyte, and cell level testing with a suitably modified cathode and anode. A successful Phase I program will lay the foundation for prototype cell and cell-pack demonstration in Phase II, where Li-ion cells will be designed, assembled, and tested to meet the requirements of NASA for safety, cycle life and energy density. Prototype cells will be delivered to NASA at the end of the Phase II program.",

      "description": "<p>The North America Array (NAA), also known as the next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA), is a concept for a radio astronomical interferometric array operating in the frequency range 1.2 GHz to 116 GHz and designed to provide substantial improvements in sensitivity, angular resolution, and frequency coverage above the current Very Large Array (VLA). JPL is in a unique position both to enable the North America Array and to benefit from it. &nbsp;With its frequency coverage, the North America Array would cover all of the deep space communication frequency allocations and all of the planetary radar frequency allocations. &nbsp;Under this effort we are designing an ultra-wideband receiver package designed to operate across the 8 to 48 GHz frequency range in contrast to the current VLA which covers this frequency range with five receiver packages. &nbsp;Reducing the number of receiving systems required to cover the full frequency range would reduce operating costs. The objective of this work is to develop a prototype integrated feed-receiver package with a sensitivity performance comparable to current narrower band systems on radio telescopes and the DSN, but with a design that meets the requirement of low long-term operational costs.&nbsp;</p><p>This effort focuses on the development of a prototype ultra-wideband feed-receiver package for the North America Array. &nbsp;Much like the case for the Deep Space Network (DSN), operational costs are increasingly recognized as a factor in determining the viability for current and future radio telescopes. &nbsp;For the North America Array to achieve the required sensitivity, the feed-receiver systems will have to be cryogenically cooled, but in order to minimize operational costs associated with the cryogenics, the number of such feed-receiver systems should be minimized. &nbsp;Similarly, integrated and easily serviceable feed-receiver systems are expected to reduce maintenance costs and downtime. &nbsp;These considerations lead us to target the development of an integrated, cryogenically-cooled feed-receiver package with a continuous instantaneous frequency coverage of 8-48 GHz which delivers a sensitivity performance comparable to current narrower band systems on radio telescopes and the DSN. The aforementioned receiver should be low cost, easy to manufacture and easy to service. &nbsp; In concert with other groups developing systems at lower frequencies, we would demonstrate that key components of the North America Array are sufficiently mature in time for the 2020 Astronomy Decadal Survey. Once the NAA is included in the Decadal Survey, the ultimate goal is to receive strong backing from the radio astronomy community such that the National Science Foundation decides to fund&nbsp;its construction.&nbsp;The DSN and current radio telescope receiving systems define the state-of-the-art in receivers. &nbsp;DSN receivers have extremely low system temperatures, typically 25 K or better, but in fairly narrow bands (mostly at S-, X-, and Ka bands) with typical bandwidths no larger than 10%. &nbsp;The Very Large Array (VLA), operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), employs five different receiving systems which mostly cover the 8&ndash;49 GHz frequency range (8-10 GHz, 13-15 GHz, 20.2-22.2 GHz, 31-33 GHz and 40-42 GHz). &nbsp;These systems have typical receiver temperatures of 25 K or so over octave or narrower bandwidths. &nbsp;By contrast, our proposed ultra-wideband receiving system design will relax the sensitivity requirement slightly in order to obtain a much larger frequency coverage and lower associated long-term operational costs.</p>",

With input images that have 30 times higher spatial resolution than &ldquo;seeing-limited&rdquo; designs (i.e., all radial velocity predecessors), iLocater will simultaneously achieve high spectral resolution (R=110,000), high throughput, and a compact optical design at low cost. By operating in a new wavelength range, the infrared, and simultaneously correcting for image-blurring effects introduced by Earth&rsquo;s turbulent atmosphere, iLocater will generate the first Doppler measurements with sufficient precision (20 cm/s) to detect the gravitational reflex motion caused by Earth-like planets orbiting the nearest stars. iLocater will directly support three NASA space missions through dedicated RV observations (TESS, JWST, WFIRST) .</p><p>The first goal of this proposal is to complete the design of iLocater&rsquo;s cryostat. The spectrograph is a cross-dispersed echelle that operates in the Y-band from 0.95-1.12 microns. The spectrograph will be evacuated (UHV 10<sup>-9</sup> Torr goal), surrounded by a precision temperature-controlled radiation shield, and enclosed in an outer chamber made of stainless steel.&nbsp; Trade studies between cryogen-fed and mechanical cryocooler designs will be performed.&nbsp; The second goal is to design customized designs for the mounting of the spectrograph optics.&nbsp; Proposal tasks include: fully incorporating the iLocater cryostat design into Solidworks and Comsol and initializing the thermal model by specifying conduction paths, thermal feedback channels, and ambient temperature fluctuations; designing mechanical mounts; incorporating mounts into the thermal model, and refining the radiation shield and mechanical design by minimizing thermal gradients.&nbsp; Deliverables are designs for the optical element mounts (including the detector and fiber feeds), plus designs for the cryostat and temperature control system.</p>",

      "description": "This proposal requests funds to continue a laboratory program in close coordination with radio astronomical observations dedicated to the study of highly reactive polyatomic molecular ions in low density regions and photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). In doing so, the proposed studies will advance our understanding of the chemistry beyond light ions that have been observed so successfully in these regions with Herschel and recently extended with SOFIA, and thereby critically address a significant but unresolved question in molecular astronomy:  Are larger molecules formed in a bottom-up or top-down chemistry?  The rotational spectra of most new molecular ions will be detected in the laboratory in a resonant microwave cavity, followed either by microwave/millimeter-wave double resonance or millimeter/THz absorption to better characterize their spectrum in bands covered by the heterodyne receivers HIFI on Herschel and GREAT on SOFIA.  In collaboration with radioastronomer colleagues, we will search for the new ions in the published survey of the PDR region of the Orion~Bar and archival data of other PDRs observed with the IRAM 30 m telescope; retrieve and analyze archival data from Herschel; and undertake searches for some of the new ions in PDRs and low density regions with SOFIA. This work will also have a strong bearing on proposed Early Release Science (ERS) observations of dense PDRs with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The laboratory effort will build on previous work on molecular ions , specifically detection of the rotational spectra of a number of positive ions of astronomical interest such as H2NCO+, CCCH+, the cis- and trans isomers of HOSO+, HNCOH+, and H2CC(H)CNH+.  We will focus our efforts on positive ions derived from closed-shell neutral molecules, radicals, and carbenes whose rotational spectra have been observed in our laboratory, and nearly all of which have also been identified in galactic molecular clouds. Examples of the ions we seek include polyatomic ions such as CN+, HCCCN+, HNCO+, c-C3H2+, etc. Collaborations with leading theoretical groups to accurately predict spectroscopic constants of the new ions will enhance the proposed laboratory investigations.  Instrumental refinement will also be undertaken with particular emphasis on construction of a new cryogenically cooled (~6 K) buffer gas cell.  This ultra-sensitive instrument will possess a system temperature that is nearly 50 times lower than our most sensitive cavity spectrometer, and one close to the fundamental limit set by modern technology, thereby greatly enhancing our ability to detect elusive molecular ions that are produced in very low steady state concentrations.  The essential capabilities of this instrument have already been demonstrated in collaborative investigations.     Our laboratory program is well aligned with NASA's overall mission, because we seek to understand the role of the chemical bond on a cosmic scale and to provide a firm chemical foundation by which more complicated questions of biological origins can be addressed.  The work here also provides much basic information to aid subsequent astronomical searches, particularly in the infrared. Finally, our research program is an excellent vehicle for integrating research and education.  It provides exposure to quite diverse areas of science in a setting which encourages student initiative and independent investigation.",

      "description": "The discovery of rocky planets orbiting their parent stars in the habitable zone, the area where the temperature is such that water is able to exist in liquid form, is one of the most compelling goals in astrophysics and a top priority of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. Rocky, habitable-zone planets around the stars nearest to the sun would be the most important discoveries, as they would be most amenable to study from powerful space-based instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope. None have yet been found, even though studies have convincingly demonstrated that they should be extremely common.  The most promising method of finding these planets is through Doppler velocimetry, where a star's radial velocity is analyzed for the characteristic back-and-forth motion caused by an orbiting planet. State-of-the art instruments are able to detect stellar velocities just under 1 meter/second, the speed of a human walking. Despite this achievement, this level of precision is about a factor of ten larger than the signal of an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star.  The precision of the best instruments is generally limited by the inability to compensate for tiny changes in temperature, pressure, and illumination of the optics, all of which can masquerade as velocity shifts and swamp the low signals of orbiting planets. For the next generation of instruments, whose design precisions approach or exceed the ~10 cm/s necessary to detect small, rocky planets, these noise sources will be extremely important to characterize and control.  I propose to develop novel devices and methods to calibrate, test, and improve the performance of ultra-high precision Doppler velocimeters. These devices will simulate velocity shifts on real light, whether calibration light or starlight, using optomechanical and acousto-optical techniques. I propose to use these devices to help achieve the design goals of two instruments I am working on: Minerva, an automated, distributed-aperture robotic observatory dedicated to precision Doppler velocimetry every night; and LAEDI, a novel combination of an interferometer and spectrograph. If they reach their design precision, both of these instruments will be able to detect rocky, habitable-zone planets around nearby stars.",

      "description": "I propose to measure wavelengths and energy levels for the spectra of Cr I, Mn I, and Mn III covering the wavelength range 80 nm to 5500 nm, and oscillator strengths for Fe II and Cr II in the region 120 nm to 2500 nm. I shall also produce intensity calibrated atlases and linelists of the iron-neon and chromium-neon hollow cathode lamps that can be compared with astrophysical spectra. The spectra will be obtained from archival data from spectrometers at NIST and Kitt Peak National Observatory and additional experimental observations as necessary from Fourier transform (FT) and grating spectrometers at NIST. The wavelength uncertainty of the strong lines will be better than 1 part in 10^7. The radiometric calibration of the spectra will be improved in order to reduce the uncertainty of measured oscillator strengths in the near UV region and extend the wavelength range of these measurements down to 120 nm. These will complement and support the measurements of lifetimes and branching fractions by J. E. Lawler in the near UV region.  An intensive effort by NIST and Imperial College London that was partly funded by previous NASA awards has resulted in comprehensive analyses of the spectra of Fe II, Cr II and Cu II, with similar analyses of Mn II, Ni II, and Sc II underway. The species included in this proposal will complete the analysis of the first two ionization stages of the elements titanium through nickel using the same techniques, and add the spectrum of Mn III - one of the most important doubly-ionized elements. The elements Cr I and Mn I give large numbers of spectral lines in spectra of cool stars and important absorption lines in the interstellar medium. The spectrum of Mn III is important in chemically peculiar stars and can often only be studied in the UV region. Analyses of many stellar spectra depend on comprehensive analyses of iron-group elements and are hampered by incomplete spectroscopic data.  As a result of many decades of work by the group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) accurate lifetimes exist for many of the most important levels of the iron-group elements needed for the interpretation of astrophysical spectra. The accuracy of the oscillator strengths is now limited by the accuracy of the branching fractions, particularly when the branches from an  upper level span a wide wavelength range that requires multiple calibration lamps. A laser-driven light source as a calibration lamp will reduce the calibration uncertainty in the UV region. Our FT and grating spectrometers will  be used to extend the wavelength region of the measurements from 120 nm to 2500 nm. Fe II and Cr II give thousands of lines in the UV stellar spectra but  accurate oscillator strengths are available only for a few hundred in each  species.    Many lines remain unidentified in the laboratory spectra of Fe/Ne and Cr/Ne hollow cathode lamps that correspond to lines in stellar spectra. The proposed atlases and linelists of these lamps will assist astronomers in confirming the species of these spectra lines and help them to identify lines of other elements in stellar spectra that are not blended with iron or chromium lines.  These measurements will be of importance in interpreting spectra obtained from many current and future NASA missions including the Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope and SOFIA. They will be particularly important in  the analysis of spectra from the ASTRAL project -  a large HST Treasury program that recorded the spectra of 29 bright and characteristic stars at high  resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio. They will also be important for the interpretation of spectra from ground-based optical and infrared spectrographs. The proposed work thus supports the NASA Objective to explore the universe to understand its origin, structure, evolution and destiny.",

For example, these technologies are being utilized to develop a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spacecraft simulator that is able to execute the unmodified (not recompiled) flight binaries of three flight computers which then interact with other modeled components, including virtual MIL-STD-1553 busses. This entire environment is running in two virtual machines on commodity laptops. Another example is the TMC-developed simulator for NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) launch vehicle that contains triple-redundant flight computer models running the as-delivered flight software binary. The core modeling and simulation technologies which are leveraged in these examples are available for use on this SBIR and are also applicable to unmanned (aircraft) system test beds. PVATS is directly applicable to complex unmanned systems requiring rigid software testing requirements, providing a portable environment for testing avionics and payload software early in the life-cycle.TMC's experience has shown that NASA hardware test beds, which usually incorporate extremely specialized hardware, are overscheduled and prone to downtime due to integration and hardware failures. PVATS provides a virtual dry-run test environment that can be utilized prior to testing in hardware labs, ensuring a more efficient lab test experience.<br /><br />PVATS has applicability to Non-NASA applications. It can be used by multiple government and private entities for V&V of unmanned systems. V&V of unmanned systems remains a challenging field mainly due to system complexity and the large number of requirements levied by diverse stakeholders. NASA unmanned systems research is similar to other agencies and private companies that utilize unmanned systems, including utilization of remote command and control systems. In any developed UAS system, there is a computing architecture that can be modeled and exercised with input/output (I/0) interfaces in order to provide a virtual unmanned system for V&V risk reduction and to assist with validating aircraft technologies including the maintenance of separation distances from other aircraft.",

These reusable technologies, already developed under a NASA contract, are also applicable to unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and will provide a portable, faster-than-real-time test bed capable of dynamic analysis, fault injection, and automated testing, including Monte Carlo analysis.   This test bed, named Portable Virtual Aircraft Test System (PVATS), leverages TMC's existing virtualization and modeling technologies to create a virtual environment that includes a CPU instruction set emulator and modeled UAS components such as sensors and actuators, and which executes in an automated virtual machine.    The PVATS goals are to directly improve the timeliness and thoroughness of test and evaluation outcomes while reducing costs and increasing UAS flight software assurance.  The three targeted goals are 1) V&V of UAS flight software, 2) Assist UAS software development and early testing by providing many portable virtual test environments to developers, and 3) Training of UAS operators using a virtual environment.",

      "benefits": "The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) performs research in the areas of Earth Science, Planetary Science, Heliophysics, and Astrophysics. All of these areas involve the common need for conceptual and preliminary design of complex system models and the attendant engineering visualization this implies. The same need to more readily build and execute more sophisticated engineering models exists within other NASA directorates as well: Aeronautics Research, Human Exploration and Operations, and Space Technology. As NASA develops the next generation of scientific and space exploration missions there is a growing need for an integrated and collaborative visualization environment that can be used to rapidly evaluate competing vehicle and mission concepts. Current NASA projects that exemplify this need include the James Webb Telescope, robotic space probe missions, future manned space exploration capsules, potential heavy launch propulsion systems, new low noise, low emission, and fuel efficient airliner designs, and future air traffic control concepts. JPL's System F6 effort (for DARPA) and their TeamX environment are possible specific beneficiaries of this system. The F6 program already uses Phoenix Integration's current visualization system. Aeronautics programs at Langley have also used this system and would benefit from the proposed new visualizer.<br /><br />Due to its generic nature, there are numerous non-NASA applications that will benefit from improved design-space visualization technology. These include a wide range of military and civilian design programs in domains such as aircraft, automotive, electronics, heavy machinery, shipbuilding, and alternative energy design projects. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are all current Phoenix customers and could make good use of better visualization technology. The company is well positioned to introduce this technology to organizations in various sectors such as BAE, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Pratt and Whitney, Raytheon, Dresser-Rand, GE, etc. since they already utilize the company's current products. Many, indeed, already use the legacy visualization system this SBIR will replace. Many are also adopting more integrated approaches to engineering and system modeling, for which the new visualization system will be designed. A common driver for all customers is the economic need to improve the design process for ever more complex systems. A major goal, therefore, is enabling greater intuition and exploration of complex trade spaces early in the design process.",
      "description": "NASA is emphasizing the use of larger, more integrated models in conjunction with systems engineering tools and decision support systems. These tools place a corresponding stress on legacy engineering visualization systems which now are required to handle larger data sets, provide more intuition to the user, integrate well with many other tools, and help the user with his/her ultimate goal: improving the design of complex systems.     Phoenix Integration proposes to complete the prototype visualization environment created during Phase I to the point where it is a commercially viable product. New features, refinements, and integration with other tools will be accomplished in Phase II. In particular, the work will involve major improvements to whitespace exploration algorithms, techniques that enable users to unconstrain or modify the underlying engineering model in an effort to obtain results in previously unattainable areas. Work will also include more data mining algorithms (e.g. Principal Component Analysis), new graph types (e.g. spider plots), export formats to 3-D tools (e.g. Tecplot), integration with MBSE/SysML tools, integration with web-based decision support environments, and incorporation of probabilistic analysis. A rich integration with ModelCenter, the company's engineering integration and trade study environment, is planned, although a standalone capability will also be offered. The visualizer's architecture will be based on OpenGL and will use the GPU to parallelize rendering computations. Design will focus on usability and responsiveness, with the goal of providing quick insight into complex data. The tool will be user-tested through early adopters to ensure relevance and to guide development.",

      "description": "During our Phase 1 NIAC study we discovered a novel coating we call “Solar White” that, when used in deep space, is predicted to reflect more than 99.9% of the sun's energy. We have shown analytically that a sphere covered with a 10 mm thick coating of Solar White and located far from the Earth and at 1 Astronomical Unit from the Sun can achieve a steady state temperature below 50 K, the freezing point of oxygen. The ramifications of such a coating are broad and significant, ranging from enabling long-term cryogenic storage to allowing passive high temperature superconductor operation in space. However, the development of these coatings is only at a theoretical modeling stage. The next two significant steps required to advance this breakthrough technology are to fabricate these coatings and test their performance. Construction of rigid versions of the coatings may be difficult, because they are composed of only one material deposited onto a metallic reflector, though there are precedents such as rigid foam and Space Shuttle Tiles to use as models. We have access to chemistry and materials experts who will work on constructing the coatings and we will liaise with Ames Research Center to help leverage the expertise available at that NASA center. Testing of our algorithms can be performed in parallel because we can construct non-rigid versions of the Solar White Coating consisting of powdered materials sandwiched between a mirror and a cover slide as a test sample. Testing would occur in a simulated deep space environment, which we will create using a vacuum chamber, a 20K cryo-cooler, and an irradiance source. By monitoring the difference in steady-state temperature in the test sample with and without irradiated energy and comparing this against our algorithmic predictions will be able to refine our models of these novel coatings when exposed to solar and infrared irradiance. We have shown in our Phase I effort that the use of Solar White could theoretically allow liquid oxygen to be maintained on a long duration mission to Mars. The Solar White coating does this by reducing not only solar heating, but also radiative heating from other, warmer, portions of the Mars vehicle and conductive heating along support struts and flow lines. We now propose to extend the deep space cryogenic use of this exciting new coating by examining the storage of LOX on the Moon. We will also examine the use of Solar White on a LOX/LN2 deep space storage depot and determine the possible locations of this depot relative to infrared emitters such as planets and moons, as well as the Sun and nearby space vehicles.",

      "closeoutSummary": "There are many challenges involved in deep-space exploration, but several of these can be mitigated, or even solved, by the development of a coating that reflects most of the Sun’s energy, yet still provides far-infrared heat emission. Such a coating would allow non-heat-generating objects in space to reach cryogenic temperatures without using an active cooling system. This would benefit deep-space sensors that require low temperatures, such as the James Webb Telescope focal plane array. It would also allow the use of superconductors in deep space, which could lead to magnetic energy storage rings, lossless power delivery, or perhaps a large-volume magnetic shield against galactic cosmic radiation. However, perhaps the most significant enablement achieved from such a coating would be the long-term, deep space storage of cryogenic liquids, such as liquid oxygen (LOX). In our Phase I NIAC study, we realized that a combination of scattering particles and a silver backing could yield a highly effective, very broadband, reflector that could potentially reflect more than 99.9% of the Sun’s irradiant power. We developed a sophisticated model of this reflector and theoretically showed that cryogenic temperatures could be achieved in deep space at one astronomical unit (1 AU) from the Sun. We showed how this new reflector could minimize heat conduction into the cryogenic tanks by coating the tank support struts. We then modelled a strawman architecture for a mission to Mars, using a coated LOX tank, coated struts, and infrared shields, to show that with our new coating it would be possible to maintain liquid oxygen passively. As a result of this work a patent application was generated and a paper published in Optics Letters [7]. Our Phase II NIAC study had two primary goals, to develop a rigid version of the cryogenic selective surface proposed in Phase I and to test its performance in a simulated deep space environment. During the first year of the project the work concentrated on developing rigid tiles of BaF2, leading to tiles as large as 4 inches in diameter that transmitted very little visible light. In addition, during the first year a simulated deep space environment was created using a vacuum chamber and cryocooler. Using this facility, we showed that our BaF2 tiles absorbed less than ¼% of 375 nm radiation, a significant milestone for the work. During the second year of the project, we continued to develop the BaF2 tiles and we put significant effort into the construction of a deep space environment where we could project simulated solar radiation onto a sample. In the spring of 2018, we conducted our first solar simulator test with BaF2 and saw about 3.6% absorption. This is better than the state-of-the-art, but disappointing since predictions were for much lower absorption. We, erroneously, attributed this absorption to water retention by the BaF2, and decided to change materials. We considered several oxides and settled on yttrium oxide (Y2O3) for further development, because it is broadband, lightweight, has high index, and is hydrophobic. In July 2018 we conducted our first test of a rigid tile of Y2O3 in the simulated deep space environment and saw significant absorption again. We then realized that the issue was not water, but mid-wave radiation passing through the tile and being absorbed by the temperature sensor and the varnish used to hold it in place. We wrapped the sensor in silver foil, re-ran the test, and saw much lower absorption; only 1.1%. We then re-ran the BaF2 tile and saw 1.4% absorption. These values are almost adequate to maintain LOX in deep space, but we suspect that there are still issues in our test apparatus; we suspect thermocouple wires may be absorbing radiation. Further, post-NIAC, testing will better determine the performance of our new solar reflector. In order to restrict the size of this report, we will only briefly describe topics that we have previously published, allowing us to devote more time to new material. So minimal material will be devoted to modeling the material and deep space cryogenic storage, while longer sections will cover our material development, simulated deep space testing, and new applications. The Launch Service Program (LSP) requested that we explore ways to use this new coating to maintain LOX in low Earth Orbit and that work is described. In addition, the Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) Program asked us to explore ways to reduce the heat load for liquid hydrogen, resulting in the development of a spray-on version of the coating that should significantly improve in-space multi-layer insulation performance.",
